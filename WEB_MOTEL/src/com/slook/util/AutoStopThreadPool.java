/**
 * A pool of threads which execute tasks, and which will shut down after all tasks have been completed.
 * Tasks, during their execution, may schedule further tasks for execution.
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * <p>Firstly the object is created, and then tasks are added using the <code>addTask</code> method.
 * (These tasks, when executed, may add other tasks, also using the <code>addTask</code> method.)
 * The <code>execute</code> method is then called; this starts the threads and returns when all tasks (and tasks created by
 * those tasks) have been completed.
 * <pre>
 *  String name = "my-task";  // Thread name; visible in debugger
 *  int workerThreadCount = 4;
 *  final AutoStopThreadPool pool = new AutoStopThreadPool(name, workerThreadCount);
 *  pool.addTask(new Runnable() { ....; if (..) pool.addTask(...); });
 *  pool.execute();   // Blocks until all tasks completed; rethrows any exception thrown by a task</pre></p>
 *
 * <p>The threads are only created when the <code>execute</code> method is called: if they were started when the object was instanciated
 * then they would stop again immediately due to there being no tasks at that point in time.</p>
 *
 * <p>There is no way to specify a maximum size of the queue of tasks.
 * The queue of tasks to be executed is necessarily unbounded:
 * if it had a fixed size, and adding a new task would block until space was available, and the entity adding the task
 * was itself a task, deadlock could occur. If there were <i>n</i> threads, the queue was full, and all <i>n</i> threads tried to add new tasks,
 * then they would all block waiting for space to be available in the queue, yet space would never become available as all tasks
 * would be waiting.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Difference from JVM Thread Pools</h3>
 *
 * <p>Thread pools such as {@link ExecutorService} offered by the JVM have two phases:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Firstly tasks are added and can be executed,</li>
 * <li>Secondly the pool is "shut down" and one can wait until all tasks have been completed;
 *  no more tasks may be added</li>
 * </ol>
 * However, if tasks may schedule further tasks for execution, then tasks can necessarily only execute in the first phase.
 * But waiting for all tasks to be completed can only occur in the second phase.
 * Therefore it is not possible to wait until all tasks have been completed, if tasks can schedule other tasks.
 *
 * <p>The object is named after cassette players which boast the feature "auto stop", meaning they stop automatically
 * once the cassette is finished.</p>
